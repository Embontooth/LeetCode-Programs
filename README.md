This repository contains all of my codes for leetcode questions that I have solved so far. I plan on updating this as I continue to solve. 
Many of the codes are not optimised and may not be the fastest solutions bu they are what came to my mind as i tried solving the questions.
I Hope this repository helps you if you're looking for the logic behind and answer.

The main branch also has the code for my class 12 school project. It uses pandas, numpy and matplotlib for data visualisation.

This is just the beginning
